# Solve

Nothing is easily identifiable but we are close to a gas station.
1/ Find the name of the brand of the gas station by typing "fuel station usa" in google image and scroll to find a gas station that has the same blue/white bands as on the photo. The brand name is "Murphy USA".
2/ Once this is done we set the scope on the city on Tulsa on Google Map and we type "murphy usa" to find the locations in the whole city. 10 addresses come out. You can check them all of if you noticed the wallmart next to the gas station you can reduce the number of possibilities.
